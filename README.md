## Overview
The Video Platform is a bespoke web application designed for Paul Leonard, a video creator, to address his branding needs and offer a dedicated platform for his videos. The system supports user registration with account verification, password reset, and email notifications. Users can navigate through video pages, share links to videos, and interact with videos using common control buttons. The platform also features a robust admin interface for video uploads and management, ensuring a seamless experience for both the creator and viewers.
